        <p class="love-letter">
            Hey bitch,
            <br>
            Trying to impress you with that chilli worked, even if it was after a decade.
            Other than your parents, I have loved you since you were a girl. You have seen me at my worst
            and my best (yet) and you stayed both times. I hope to be there and I want to ask you to 
            let me love you in every way you deserve. Let me be the one who holds your 
            hand through every high and low. Let me be the one who makes your heart feel at home, the 
            way you do for me.
            <br>
            Every day with you is a beautiful journey. You have been my best friend, now you are my girlfriend.
            From this Valentine's week, I want you to be my valentine as well. 💕
        </p>
